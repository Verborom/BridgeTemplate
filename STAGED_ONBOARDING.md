# üéØ UPDATED STAGED ONBOARDING PROTOCOL - Bridge Template GitHub Sync

## PHASE 1: COMPLETE PROJECT MASTERY (MANDATORY)
**FIRST AND MOST CRITICAL**: You must become a TOTAL EXPERT on the entire Bridge Template project.

### 1.1: Read COMPLETE_PROJECT_MASTERY.md  
This file contains the complete protocol to become an expert on EVERY aspect of the project:
- Read ALL 50+ source files
- Understand complete architecture  
- Master all build scripts
- Comprehend infinite nesting system
- Know all documentation
- Verify complete understanding through mandatory questions

**YOU CANNOT PROCEED UNTIL YOU COMPLETE THE ENTIRE MASTERY PROTOCOL**

## PHASE 2: MISSION CONTEXT (AFTER MASTERY)
Only after achieving complete project mastery:

### 2.1: Read CLAUDE_CODE_ONBOARDING.md  
- Mission-specific context
- Your role and constraints
- Critical preservation requirements

### 2.2: Read requests.txt
- Detailed technical specifications
- Step-by-step execution plan
- Success criteria and error handling

## PHASE 3: KNOWLEDGE VERIFICATION (REQUIRED)
After reading all context files AND achieving project mastery, demonstrate understanding:

1. **What type of system are you working with?**
   (Answer: Revolutionary modular development system with 15s granular builds, hot-swapping, infinite nesting)

2. **Name the 5 core systems**
   (Answer: ModuleManager, VersionManager, Intelligence, BridgeModule, Platform Integration)

3. **What enables 15-second builds?**
   (Answer: Granular Development Intelligence with Enhanced Intent Parser and component mapping)

4. **What is infinite nesting? Give example.**
   (Answer: Components within components infinitely - Dashboard ‚Üí SystemHealth ‚Üí CPUMetrics ‚Üí Display ‚Üí Animation)

5. **What is your SPECIFIC task?**
   (Answer: Execute sync-setup.sh to connect local project to GitHub - SYNC ONLY, preserve everything)

6. **What are the CRITICAL preservation rules?**
   (Answer: Preserve everything exactly, no code modifications, sync operation only)

7. **What script will you execute and what does it do?**
   (Answer: sync-setup.sh - initializes git, commits all files, connects to GitHub, pushes everything)

## PHASE 4: PRE-EXECUTION VERIFICATION (MANDATORY)
Before executing anything:

1. **Verify location**: `cd /Users/eatatjoes/Desktop/ORGANIZE!/BridgeTemplate && pwd`
2. **Confirm project contents**: `ls -la` (should see Core/, Modules/, scripts/, docs/, etc.)
3. **Verify you've read the key files**: 
   ```bash
   ls -la Core/ModuleManager/ModuleManager.swift
   ls -la Core/Intelligence/EnhancedIntentParser.swift  
   ls -la scripts/enhanced-smart-build.sh
   ls -la docs/GRANULAR_DEV_SUMMARY.md
   ```
4. **Verify sync script exists**: `ls -la sync-setup.sh`
5. **Check git status**: `ls -la | grep .git` (should show NO .git directory)

## PHASE 5: EXECUTION AUTHORIZATION
Only after completing ALL phases above and demonstrating COMPLETE PROJECT MASTERY should you request authorization.

## UPDATED SAFETY PROTOCOL
- ‚ùå **NEVER SKIP** project mastery phase
- ‚ùå **NEVER ASSUME** understanding without reading ALL files
- ‚ùå **NEVER EXECUTE** without complete architectural knowledge
- ‚ùå **NEVER MODIFY** any existing code during sync
- ‚úÖ **BECOME TOTAL EXPERT** before any action

## CRITICAL REMINDER
You are handling a revolutionary modular development system that represents the future of software architecture. It features:
- **15-second property builds** vs 5-minute traditional builds
- **Hot-swapping at runtime** without restart
- **Natural language development** interface
- **Infinite component nesting** with independent versioning
- **Surgical precision building** preserving all existing work

**Complete mastery is non-negotiable before touching this masterpiece!** üéØ
