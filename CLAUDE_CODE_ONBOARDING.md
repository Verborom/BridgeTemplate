# 🚀 Claude Code Session Onboarding - GitHub Sync Mission

## YOUR ROLE: Technical Execution Specialist
You are Claude Code in the terminal, responsible for executing the critical GitHub synchronization task.

## PROJECT CONTEXT: Bridge Template Revolution
This is NOT a regular project. You're working with a revolutionary modular development system that features:
- **15-second component builds** instead of 5-minute full rebuilds
- **Hot-swapping modules** at runtime without restart
- **Natural language interface** for development ("fix the CPU animation" → precise builds)
- **Infinite nesting architecture** with independent versioning at every level

## CRITICAL MISSION: Connect Local Project to GitHub
The complete revolutionary system exists locally but has NEVER been connected to GitHub. This breaks:
- ❌ RAG system (can't see actual codebase)
- ❌ GitHub Actions (workflows exist but never triggered)  
- ❌ Session continuity (no context preservation)
- ❌ Documentation automation (can't generate from code)

## YOUR SPECIFIC TASK
Execute the sync-setup.sh script to connect everything. This is a **SYNC OPERATION ONLY** - not development.

### CRITICAL RULES:
- ⚠️ **PRESERVE EVERYTHING** - Do not modify any existing code
- ⚠️ **SYNC ONLY** - Do not attempt to "improve" anything
- ⚠️ **FOLLOW SCRIPT** - Let sync-setup.sh handle all operations
- ⚠️ **NO CREATIVE CHANGES** - This is connection work only

## LOCATION CONTEXT
```
Project: /Users/eatatjoes/Desktop/ORGANIZE!/BridgeTemplate/
Status: Complete revolutionary system, never connected to GitHub
Target: https://github.com/Verborom/BridgeTemplate.git
```

## EXECUTION APPROACH
1. **Read requests.txt** for detailed specifications
2. **Verify project location** and contents
3. **Execute sync-setup.sh** script exactly as designed
4. **Provide authentication** when prompted (user will supply)
5. **Verify successful connection** to GitHub
6. **Confirm GitHub Actions triggered**

## SUCCESS INDICATORS
- ✅ Git repository initialized locally
- ✅ All files committed and pushed to GitHub
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflows running
- ✅ RAG system can now see complete codebase

## POST-SYNC IMPACT
Once you complete this sync:
- 🤖 RAG system will see the revolutionary architecture
- 📚 Documentation will auto-generate from code comments
- 🔄 Session continuity will work across Claude conversations
- ⚡ GitHub Actions will process the granular development system
- 🌉 Complete Bridge Template ecosystem will be fully operational

## ERROR PROTOCOL
If anything fails:
1. Report exact error message
2. Show current status
3. Do NOT attempt manual fixes
4. Ask for guidance

You're connecting a masterpiece to its automation infrastructure. Execute with precision! 🎯
