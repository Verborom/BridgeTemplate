# Bridge Template - Version Control Setup
STATUS: URGENT_SETUP
TIMESTAMP: 2025-07-25T20:45:00Z
REQUEST_TYPE: version_control_setup
DESCRIPTION: Initialize Git and GitHub backup for Bridge Template project

## OBJECTIVE
Set up proper version control for the Bridge Template project to protect our work and enable collaboration.

## CURRENT SITUATION
- ✅ Project structure is solid with v1.0.0 foundation
- ✅ BridgeMac.app working and built
- ❌ Git not initialized (.git directory missing)
- ❌ No GitHub backup currently active
- ✅ GitHub sync script exists and ready

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS NEEDED

### 1. Initialize Git Repository
```bash
cd /Users/eatatjoes/Desktop/ORGANIZE!/BridgeTemplate
./scripts/github-sync.sh init
```

### 2. Set Up GitHub Repository
During the init process, you'll need:
- GitHub repository URL (create one if needed)
- Repository should be named: `BridgeTemplate` or similar

### 3. Commit Current State
The init process will:
- Initialize git repository
- Add all current files
- Create initial commit with v1.0.0 state
- Set up remote connection to GitHub

### 4. Backup Builds
```bash
./scripts/github-sync.sh backup
```

## WHAT TO DO NOW

1. **Create GitHub Repository First** (if you don't have one):
   - Go to GitHub.com
   - Create new repository named "BridgeTemplate"
   - Make it private (recommended) or public
   - Don't initialize with README (we already have one)
   - Copy the repository URL

2. **Run the Setup**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/eatatjoes/Desktop/ORGANIZE!/BridgeTemplate
   ./scripts/github-sync.sh init
   ```

3. **When prompted for GitHub URL, paste your repository URL**

4. **Verify it worked**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/github-sync.sh status
   ```

## SUCCESS CRITERIA
- ✅ Git repository initialized
- ✅ GitHub remote configured
- ✅ Initial commit created with all current files
- ✅ v1.0.0 state backed up to GitHub
- ✅ Build metadata backed up

## NEXT STEPS AFTER VERSION CONTROL
Once version control is working:
1. Arc Browser visual enhancement (v1.0.1)
2. Core functionality implementation
3. Regular GitHub syncs with each version

This is a one-time setup that will protect all our future work!
