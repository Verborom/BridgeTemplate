=== UniversalComponent Protocol Analysis ===

✅ UniversalComponent.swift found
Protocol is imported from UniversalTemplate package, not duplicated

✅ BaseComponent.swift found
Implementation uses BaseComponent from UniversalTemplate

✅ Package.swift found
Package structure:
- Name: BridgeTemplateApp
- Platforms: macOS 14+, iOS 17+
- Dependency: UniversalTemplate (relative path)
- Clean target structure

=== CICD Structure Analysis ===

✅ GitHub Actions directory found (.github/workflows/)
- ci.yml references reusable workflow: universal-component.yml
- Proper hierarchy level: app
- Follows modern GitHub Actions patterns

✅ Tests directory found
- Proper test structure with XCTest
- Tests component creation and execution

✅ No build script in individual component
- This is correct - build commands in Package.swift

=== Key Findings ===

1. UniversalTemplate generates clean, modern Swift packages
2. Each component gets its own independent structure
3. CICD is built-in with reusable workflows
4. Proper test structure included
5. Uses BaseComponent pattern (implements UniversalComponent)
6. No protocol duplication - imports from UniversalTemplate
