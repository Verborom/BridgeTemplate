=== BridgeTemplate Integration Analysis ===

## Current BridgeTemplate Structure:
Main directories: Core, Modules, Platforms, scripts, docs, UniversalTemplate, Tests, builds, archive

## Generated UniversalTemplate Structure:
Clean Swift package with Sources, Tests, Package.swift, README, and .github/workflows

## Key Integration Points:

### Directory Conflicts:
✅ Safe: Core not generated by UniversalTemplate
✅ Safe: Modules not generated by UniversalTemplate
✅ Safe: Platforms not generated by UniversalTemplate
✅ Safe: scripts not generated by UniversalTemplate
✅ Safe: docs not generated by UniversalTemplate

### File Conflicts:
⚠️  Conflict: Package.swift exists in main project root
⚠️  Conflict: README.md exists in main project root
✅ Safe: .gitignore not generated by UniversalTemplate

### Integration Strategy:
1. UniversalTemplate creates components in their own directories
2. No overlap with existing project structure
3. Each component is self-contained with own Package.swift
4. Can coexist with current structure during migration

### Key Advantages:
1. Clean separation of concerns
2. Each component has independent versioning
3. Built-in CICD for every component
4. No interference with existing code
5. Gradual migration possible

### Migration Path:
1. Create new components using UniversalTemplate
2. Existing modules already use UniversalComponent
3. Replace Core systems one by one
4. Update app layer to use UniversalComponent
5. Remove old BridgeModule code when complete
